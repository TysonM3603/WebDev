    <p>
      Tyson's Trades and Cards is dedicated to making your trading card shopping
      experience easier and more streamlined. Instead of searching for far away
      sellers which can make cards take a while to reach you, our algorithm
      searches for the <em>nearest</em> card shops and sellers to you so that
      the time is <em>cut in half</em> with the search. We also have a system to
      allow for trading between you and other sellers so that you can get rid of
      cards you don't want in place of cards you want. Our goal is to open the
      world of trading card games to everyone!
