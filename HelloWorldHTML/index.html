        <h2>Playing Video Games</h2>
        <p>
            One of my most favorite things that I like to do is play video games. I have been playing video games since I was old enough to know what they were (I can't 
            remember specifics, but it was probably when I was around 6 or 7 years old). I grew up with the Nintendo Gameboy Advance and the Nintendo Gamecube and instantly
            fell in love with classics like Super Mario World, Mario Kart Double Dash, and Super Mario Bros 3. Later on this hobby would branch out into the hit game
            Minecraft back in 2011. I remember one day when a kid I barely knew called me and wanted to know if I wanted to play Minecraft with him on his xbox since
            it had just come out. I thought it would be fun and from that day forward that kid became my best friend and Minecraft became a classic game in my heart
            that I still play today. Eventually I would get more game consoles like an Xbox 360 from my grandma, a Nintendo DS, and also some laptops to play games on
            as well.

            To me it doesn't really matter what console or system you play games on. What does matter is the content that you get to enjoy by playing them. You can
            platform through the Mushroom Kingdom with Mario and Luigi, you can choose heroes to battle it out in games like Overwatch or Apex Legends, create worlds
            full of detail and beauty in sandbox games like Minecraft or Terraria, and you can experience stories that are written fantastically in games like The Last
            of Us that are almost on par with movies. There are many different styles of games you can play and ways to express yourself with character creation and the
            option of playing by yourself or with friends. Video Games are a way for me to wind down after a long and stressful day and allow me to immerse myself in a world
            that is full of wonder, awe, and excitement or possibly fearful and scary. I am always looking forward to new game releases and enjoy playing all sorts of games
            with my friends and family and am grateful that I learned what they were at such a young age.
